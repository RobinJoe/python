<screen>The error is caused due to Automate generating incorrect XML. The CPU definition contained the unrecognised elements 'sockets'and 'cores' which are attributes of the topology element. Hence, after upgrading RHEVm from 3.3 to 3.4, the user cannot provision new VMs from CloudForms Management Engine. The RHEVm log contains the error 'unexpected element (uri:"", local:"sockets")'.
A number of fixes were incorporated to ensure that the CPU definition is generated correctly.
The user is now able to provision new VMs from CFME.

<screen>When connecting to a virtual machine from CloudForms EVM using the latest version of VMRC, the process failed to complete, resulting in issues like the console button being rendered unusable, or error messages such as the VMRC plugin not being installed or that the feature is only available in Firefox or Internet Explorer. The two major issues were that EVM was using previously installed versions of VMRC rather than the most updated ones and that EVM, in some cases, was incorrectly detecting Internet Explorer 11 as Firefox and providing wrong paths. These issues have been fixed in the most recent version. Connecting to a virtual machine from CloudForms EVM should work correctly.

<screen>In the beta version of CloudForms Management Engine 5.3, if an infrastructure provider was removed, then added again, the relationships between the provider and its clusters and hosts were not refreshed. This was because, the old provider information was not deleted from host records when the provider was deleted. When the same infrastructure provider was added back and a refresh was initiated, the hosts could not resolve provider information and got an object not found error. This bug was fixed by nullifying the provider information on hosts when deleting the provider. Now, when the provider is added back, the hosts look up provider information as expected.

<screen>When CFME is used to request the creation of a virtual machine, creates the virtual machine instance but throws an error message, leading users to believe that the virtual machine was not created. This was caused by the state machine running post_create_destination twice.

<screen>Deploying multiple virtual machines failed with the following message:

"RhevmApiError: Failed updating the properties of the VM. This may be caused either by:
1. The values selected are not appropriate for the VM; or
2. Its values cannot be updated while the VM is in UP state (Please shut down the VM in order to modify properties such as CPU or cluster)."

This was caused by RHEV-M returning a state of "complete" in the creation_status URL, leading to a request being made to the RHEV API to change a value on the virtual machine, but the virtual machine's URL was still reporting a state of "image_locked". A test has been added to to detect and re-queue the modification request if the destination image is in a state of "image_locked". The virtual machines now deploy successfully.

Fixed code to redirect user to a screen that they have access to when user switches between groups. Moved code that sets start page url into its own common method so it can be used when switching between groups and when user first logs in. Also, added spec test for "start_url_for_user" method to ensure it returns correct url when switching between user's group which has fixed the issue.

<screen>When an OpenStack instance has multiple security groups assigned, the CloudForms web UI for that instance detail only has reference to one of the security groups the instance is assigned to. The security groups themselves seem to display this relationship accurately in that all VMs that have a security group assigned are seen, but not from the instance detail.

Fixed link to Security Groups to show the list of security groups. Thereby, the CloudForms webUI now displays all the security groups on the instance summary page, so the issue is fixed.

<screen>When attempting to use the Integration / VimApi / VMware_HotAdd_Disk method to add a disk to a VM in VMware, a ruby error was generated and disk wasn’t being added.

The MiqVimVm#addDisk method was using the public accessor dsName2mo() when creating the ConfigSpec used to add a disk to the VM; causing the returned object to be wrapped in a MiqDrbReturn object. This caused the MiqDrbReturn object to be passed back to the client, since only top-level return objects should be wrapped in MiqDrbReturn. The client would then pass this unexpected object to the VMware VIM API, causing the failure.

Using the internal accessor dsName2mo_local() when acquiring sub-objects of the ConfigSpec, since this method does not wrap its returned value in a MiqDrbReturn object was the solution.

Also, fixed VMware service model methods for set_memory and add_disk; both method names were incorrectly set to an existing method name in a previous refactoring. This has fixed the issue and disk is  now being added to a VM in Vmware without any error.
